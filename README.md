# AWS-CLI-with-MFA
A best practice for IAM users is to use MFA. This is especially true when it comes to users in the admin group and should be a basic requirement. In a large multiple account setup where admin users are allowed to roleswitch, a compromised admin account without MFA can cause incredible damage. 

But MFA presents a problem. How do we enforce MFA on a legacy account with an established IAM account structure? And how do we do MFA for CLI?

Turns out itâ€™s only possible to enforce MFA for CLI when assuming a role. This is useful knowledge because the same pattern can be used to enforce MFA is used for admin roles in child accounts.

## Assume role with CLI
Following instruction is for OS X. Windows and Linux is on TODO list.

When making a CLI call requiring a specific role the `--profile` option must always be appended. 
Example:

```
aws ec2 describe-hosts --region eu-west-1 --profile cli
```

In `~/.aws` there are two files of interest: `config` and `credentials`

`credentials` is automatically populated when running `aws configure` command, and contains the access key and secret access key. It can contain several profiles which is handy for dealing with different accounts. The config file can reference a profile in the credentials file, which is invoked when we make the `--profile [profilename]` call in the CLI.

### Example credentials file
```
[cli]
aws_access_key_id = AAAAACCCEEESSSSKEEEEEYYYY
aws_secret_access_key = SSSSSSUUUUUUUUPPPPEEEEERRRSEEEEEECRRRREEET
```

### Example config file
```
[profile cli]
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::<CHILD ACCOUNT NUMBER>:role/adminMFA-roleswitch
mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::<MAIN ACCOUNT NUMBER>:mfa/adminUser
source_profile = cli
```
